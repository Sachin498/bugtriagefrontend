# bugtriagefrontend
I have created this User Interface using html, css and Flask.
It is based on my project Bugtriage which helps in assigning developers to Bugs based on the developer's previous experience with solving these bugs.
We took that data and used it to create our User Interface where on providing the Bug ID we are able to find out which developer is most well-suited to solve the bug.

Two more files are required for this project to work which are too big to be uploaded here.
